Title: Simplex Optimization Algorithms for Laboratory and Manufacturing Processes

Description: Simplex optimization algorithms as firstly proposed by Spendley
    et al. (1962) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1962.10490033> and later modified by 
    Nelder and Mead (1965) <doi:10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308> for laboratory and 
    manufacturing processes. The package also provides tools for graphical 
    representation of the simplexes and some example response surfaces that 
    are useful in illustrating the optimization process.
