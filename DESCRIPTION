Description: Implementation of the simplex optimization algorithms firstly 
    proposed by Spendley et al. (1962) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1962.10490033>
    and later modified by Nelder and Mead (1965) <doi:10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308>
    for laboratory and processes applications. Tools for simplexes' graphical
    representation and some example surface responses are provided.
